###On AWS RHEL-7 serever,tried to install fwup for NERVES project
##
# The version of libconfuse available in yum is too old
curl -L https://github.com/martinh/libconfuse/releases/download/v2.8/confuse-2.8.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
pushd /tmp/confuse-2.8
./configure && make && sudo make install
popd
rm -rf /tmp/confuse-2.8

# The version of libarchive available in yum is too old
curl -L http://www.libarchive.org/downloads/libarchive-3.1.2.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp

./configure && make && sudo make install
popd

# The version of libsodium available in yum is too old

# Assuming all of the libraries were installed to /usr/local/lib
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
