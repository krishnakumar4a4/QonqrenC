I have installed erlang 19b from erlang solutions which was meant for centos7 on 3v265l which is rhel 7.2
otp 19b rpm: esl-erlang_19.0-centos-7_amd64.rpm
While installing 19b, otp 16b which was already present on this VM gave me following error 
Error: Transaction check error:
   file /usr/bin/epmd from install of esl-erlang-19.0-1.x86_64 conflicts with file from package erlang-erts-R16B-03.17.el7.x86_64
This was fixed by using yum shell mentioned in https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=50923 link, where in one transaction removes older 16b otp and replaces newer otp 19b. This excited me to document it.
Below is the excerpt, how yum shell is used

Next step would be install elixir
    In the elixir-master folder, i ran make clean test, although test got failed, I have iex and other as compiled binaries

I have brought phoenix framework from github which exists in the current folder as phoenix-master
    Now I am trying to install phoenix from the link http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation, before that mix and iex should exist in environment variable, export PATH="/root/elixir-master/bin/:$PATH"
    I have installed phoenix archive,downloaded from https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phoenix_new.ez with following command: 
    ./elixir-master/bin/mix archive.install ./phoenix_new.ez
When I ran mix in the phoenix-master folder
    Just found that hex package manager has to be installed
        *One more thing found was, mix.exs file is for mix which is like rebar.config for rebar3 file where dependencies like things are mentioned.
        Normally if I run mix inside phoenix-master folder, it initially tried to get hex package,since git clone is not working.
        I have to get the zip package  hex-master from some other server and and run mix install inside will install hex package manager.
        HEX was successful
    Now need to fetch poison,cowboy,phoenix_pubsub,plug(found this out by running mix again in pheonix-master folder)

Lot of background needs to be known here, if hex packages dependencies are to be fetched from local ~/.hex/packages, we need to add HEX_OFFLINE=true to mix deps.get which forms final command as "HEX_OFFLINE=true mix deps.get". Information obtained from https://github.com/hexpm/hex/issues/119,https://github.com/hexpm/hex/pull/128 links.

    A simple running of mix in phoenix-master folder would throw an error showing that deps should be pulled using "mix deps.get".
    When I ran that command, it tries to download one registry file using "mix hex.registry fetch" command which would eventually fail due to lack of port 443     access.
    So I did some googling and found a ready made registry file at https://github.com/erlang-nix/hex-pm-registry-snapshots/blob/master/registry.ets.gz.
    I loaded that file with "mix hex.registry load registry.ets.gz". Just eliminated that registry error(ultimately failed at some other point)
    I was able to see a list of dependency packages in mix.lock file, I have downloaded them all and placed them(after unzipping) in ~/.hex/packages folder.
    I have also changed each dependency in mix.exs deps function from {:cowboy, "~> 1.0", optional: true} to {:cowboy, override: true, path: "/root/.hex/packages/cowboy-2.0.0-pre.3/", optional: true} fashion.
    Even after changing all the dependencies in the mix.exs left me with some more dependencies which are not mentioned in the deps list when I ran mix deps.get command. I have added them to deps list mix.exs just like above by downloading them separately and placing them in ~/.hex/packages directory and re-running mix deps.get again.
    After these steps, it still tries to give http call to registry and failed.

    Now I found some useful information about dependency failures like "Unknown package version mime 1.0.1 in lockfile" while "mix deps.get" command is given.
    Link that gave this information is https://hex.pm/docs/usage
    From the link I was able to understand some update of mix dependencies has to be given periodically when mix.exs is added with new dependencies, while I gave this command "mix deps.update --all", it mime error was gone and earmark popped up it and says it can not find earmark in the cache also.
    Then I added earmark dependency entry to mix.exs to get it from hex cache(~/.hex/packages)

At last ran the "mix deps.get" and it ended well, although registry is still failing.

Now the crucial step, ran mix again and it asked for rebar3
